Pytorch codes for Open-set Adversarial Defense with Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning <a href=https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05953.pdf> (pdf) </a> in IJCV 2022.


As extension of Open-set Adversarial Defense <a href=https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2020/papers_ECCV/papers/123620664.pdf> (pdf) </a> in ECCV 2020, this paper proposes an Open-Set Defense Network with Clean-Adversarial Mutual Learning (OSDN-CAML) as a solution to the OSAD problem. The proposed network designs an encoder with dual-attentive feature-denoising layers coupled with a classifier to learn a noise-free latent feature representation. A decoder is incorporated to ensure that clean images can be well reconstructed from the obtained latent features. Then, self-supervision is used to ensure that the latent features are informative enough to carry out an auxiliary task. Finally, to exploit more complementary knowledge from clean image classiÔ¨Åcation to facilitate feature denoising and search for a more generalized local minimum for open-set recognition, we further propose clean-adversarial mutual learning, where a peer network (classifying clean images) is further introduced to mutually learn with the classifier (classifying adversarial images).

Network structure of OSDN-CAML consists of five components: encoder, decoder, open-set classifier, transformation classifier and peer learner.
